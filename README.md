## Description
This project aims to provide a device application that monitors symptoms, alerts users when a patient is experiencing sleep paralysis, and records these incidents in a historical data log. The application is developed using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and leverages [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database), written within the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) framework.

## Features
The application displays readings from sensors, which can monitor the following:
- Heart Rate: Continuously tracks the userâ€™s heart rate.
- Oxygen Level: Measures the oxygen saturation in the blood.
- Stress Level: Monitors indicators of stress
- Muscle Stiffness: Detects the stiffness of muscles, which can be indicative of sleep paralysis.
- Finger Detection: Ensures accurate placement of sensors by detecting if they are correctly positioned on the finger.
- 
Additionally, the app alerts the user when sleep paralysis threshold values are reached, triggering an alarm sound along with a vibration motor to wake the patient.
